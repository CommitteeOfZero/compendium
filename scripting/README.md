# Scripting engine specification (working draft)

This chapter deals with the scripting engine in **Steins;Gate 0 (PC)**. In this version, scripts are shipped as **(binary) bytecode** in the *SC3* format. The extension for this format is labelled *.scx*. Some earlier titles used *.scr*, for mostly the same format.
